figuring it out

learning to do anything requires sucking. Just keep focusing on the work.

As a complete amateur and someone who has rarely worked hard at anything, this is a struggle to be at the very bottom of something.  I have taken a long time to hit rock bottom, buoyed by my own arrogance and everyone around me liking me enough to both let me get away with my shit, and help if anything truly were wrong.  At this point, nothing is working and it is time to get my life together.
